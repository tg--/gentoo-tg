  This package consists of kernel.org's stable sources plus the latest grsec
  patch (usually the testing version) as well as tomoyo 1.8, aka ccs-patch.
  As the latter's grsec compatible patch for new versions usually is not
  available upstream outside of SVN, it is included here. Also, it includes
  thomasg's signature to verify that you get the same patch as has been tested.
  Upstream only signs release packages, which do not include the needed patch.
  The key id is F9E2C448 - get it at MITs PGP keyserver for example.
  The ebuild is signed as well, grsec is signed by Spender upstream.
